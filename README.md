## Introduction

**MCP Atlassian Server (by phuc-nt)** is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that connects AI agents like Cline, Claude Desktop, or Cursor to Atlassian Jira and Confluence, enabling them to query data and perform actions through a standardized interface.

> **Note:** This server is primarily designed and optimized for use with Cline, though it follows the MCP standard and can work with other MCP-compatible clients.

![Introduction Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phuc-nt/public-assets/main/mcp-atlassian-server/introduce.gif)

- **Key Features:**  
  - Connect AI agents to Atlassian Jira and Confluence
  - Support both Resources (read-only) and Tools (actions/mutations)
  - Easy integration with Cline through MCP Marketplace
  - Local-first design for personal development environments
  - Optimized integration with Cline AI assistant

## The Why Behind This Project

As a developer working daily with Jira and Confluence, I found myself spending significant time navigating these tools. While they're powerful, I longed for a simpler way to interact with them without constantly context-switching during deep work.

The emergence of AI Agents and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) presented the perfect opportunity. I immediately saw the potential to connect Jira and Confluence (with plans for Slack, GitHub, Calendar, and more) to my AI workflows.

This project began as a learning journey into MCP and AI Agents, but I hope it evolves into something truly useful for individuals and organizations who interact with Atlassian tools daily.

## Installation & Setup

For detailed installation and setup instructions, please refer to our [installation guide for AI assistants](./llms-install.md). This guide is specially formatted for AI/LLM assistants like Cline to read and automatically set up the MCP Atlassian Server.

> **Note for Cline users**: The installation guide (llms-install.md) is optimized for Cline AI to understand and execute. You can simply ask Cline to "Install MCP Atlassian Server (by phuc-nt)" and it will be able to parse the instructions and help you set up everything step-by-step.

The guide includes:
- Prerequisites and system requirements
- Step-by-step setup for Node.js environments
- Configuring Cline AI assistant to connect with Atlassian
- Getting and setting up Atlassian API tokens
- Security recommendations and best practices
