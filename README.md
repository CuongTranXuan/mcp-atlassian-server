## Introduction

**MCP Atlassian Server (by phuc-nt)** is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that connects AI agents like Cline, Claude Desktop, or Cursor to Atlassian Jira and Confluence, enabling them to query data and perform actions through a standardized interface.

> **Note:** This server is primarily designed and optimized for use with Cline, though it follows the MCP standard and can work with other MCP-compatible clients.

![Introduction Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phuc-nt/public-assets/main/mcp-atlassian-server/introduce.gif)

- **Key Features:**  
  - Connect AI agents to Atlassian Jira and Confluence
  - Support both Resources (read-only) and Tools (actions/mutations)
  - Easy integration with Cline through MCP Marketplace
  - Local-first design for personal development environments
  - Optimized integration with Cline AI assistant

## The Why Behind This Project

As a developer working daily with Jira and Confluence, I found myself spending significant time navigating these tools. While they're powerful, I longed for a simpler way to interact with them without constantly context-switching during deep work.

The emergence of AI Agents and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) presented the perfect opportunity. I immediately saw the potential to connect Jira and Confluence (with plans for Slack, GitHub, Calendar, and more) to my AI workflows.

This project began as a learning journey into MCP and AI Agents, but I hope it evolves into something truly useful for individuals and organizations who interact with Atlassian tools daily.

## Installation & Setup

For detailed installation and setup instructions, please refer to our [installation guide for AI assistants](./llms-install.md). This guide is specially formatted for AI/LLM assistants like Cline to read and automatically set up the MCP Atlassian Server.

> **Note for Cline users**: The installation guide (llms-install.md) is optimized for Cline AI to understand and execute. You can simply ask Cline to "Install MCP Atlassian Server (by phuc-nt)" and it will be able to parse the instructions and help you set up everything step-by-step.

The guide includes:
- Prerequisites and system requirements
- Step-by-step setup for Node.js environments
- Configuring Cline AI assistant to connect with Atlassian
- Getting and setting up Atlassian API tokens
- Security recommendations and best practices

sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Cline as Cline AI
    participant MCP as MCP Server
    participant Atlassian as Atlassian API
    
    User->>Cline: "Find all my assigned issues"
    Cline->>MCP: Request jira://issues
    MCP->>Atlassian: API Request with Auth
    Atlassian->>MCP: JSON Response
    MCP->>Cline: Formatted MCP Resource
    Cline->>User: "I found these issues..."
    
    User->>Cline: "Create new issue about login bug"
    Cline->>MCP: Call createIssue Tool
    MCP->>Atlassian: POST /rest/api/3/issue
    Atlassian->>MCP: Created Issue Data
    MCP->>Cline: Success Response
    Cline->>User: "Created issue DEMO-123"
```

## Example Use Cases
Try asking Cline these queries after installation:

1. **Create and Manage Tasks**
   - "Create a new issue in project DEMO about login errors"
   - "Find all issues assigned to me in the current sprint"
   - "Transition issue DEMO-43 to Done status"

2. **Project Information Summary**
   - "Summarize all issues in project DEMO"
   - "Who is assigned issues in project DEMO?"
   - "List unassigned issues in the current sprint"

3. **Documentation with Confluence**
   - "Create a Confluence page titled 'Meeting Notes'"
   - "Add a comment to the Confluence page about API Documentation"

4. **Analysis and Reporting**
   - "Compare the number of completed issues between the current and previous sprint"
   - "Who has the most issues in 'To Do' status?"

> These queries work best within the Cline environment, which has been thoroughly tested with this MCP server.

### Usage Notes

1. **Simple JQL**: When searching for issues, use simple JQL without spaces or special characters (e.g., `project=DEMO` instead of `project = DEMO AND key = DEMO-43`).

2. **Create Confluence Page**: When creating a Confluence page, use simple HTML content and do not specify parentId to avoid errors.

3. **Create Issue**: When creating new issues, only provide the minimum required fields (projectKey, summary) for best success.

4. **Access Rights**: Ensure the configured Atlassian account has access to the projects and spaces you want to interact with.

## Security Note

- Your API token inherits all permissions of the user that created it
- Never share your token with a non-trusted party
- Be cautious when asking LLMs to analyze config files containing your token
- See detailed security guidelines in [llms-install.md](./llms-install.md#security-warning-when-using-llms)
